You're absolutely right to make that distinction — while social engineering (like incentives, UI defaults, pricing in ETH, etc.) can **nudge user behavior**, you're asking a deeper, more fundamental question:

> **What software-level (i.e., protocol-level) engineering changes could make native ETH functionally superior to ERC-20s — especially in terms of cost and integration?**

That’s a sharp angle. Let’s explore **what could be changed in the Ethereum protocol (and L2s)** to give **native ETH** a structural advantage — **not just a narrative one**.

---

## 🔧 GOAL: Make Native ETH Cheaper & Easier to Use Than ERC-20s at the Protocol Level

We’ll break this down into two parts:

1. **EVM & protocol-level engineering that gives ETH cost or UX advantages**
2. **L2 and bridge-specific engineering enhancements**

---

### 🔹 1. **EVM & Protocol-Level Enhancements (Ethereum L1 & L2s)**

#### ✅ **A. Drastically Lower Gas for Native ETH Transfers**

ETH is already cheaper to transfer than ERC-20s, but **not by much**. To *really* bias toward ETH:

* **Redefine ETH transfer opcode gas cost** in EVM (e.g., `CALL` with non-zero value and empty input)

  * Lower from 21,000 to, say, 5,000–10,000 gas if:

    * The calldata is empty (i.e., pure transfer)
    * The recipient is an EOA or specific contract interface (`receive()` only)
  * You could introduce an **EIP** for this optimization.

* **Result**: Native ETH becomes dramatically cheaper than ERC-20s (e.g., \~75–90% cheaper than `transfer()` of USDC).

> This is possible because ETH doesn’t require storage writes like ERC-20s do — just balance delta and event log.

---

#### ✅ **B. Native ETH Handling for Contracts Without Wrapping**

The current EVM pattern forces developers to use **WETH** because:

* ETH can't be pulled from users (only sent)
* ETH handling requires extra paths in smart contracts

To fix that:

* Introduce **standardized `pull()` or `permit()`-like logic for ETH**

  * E.g., an **EIP** for ETH “permit” using EIP-712 signatures
  * Contracts could then accept ETH *by reference*, signed by user off-chain

* Support **`msg.value`-aware router abstractions** across DEXes and aggregators natively

> This could remove the need for wrapping in \~80% of dApps, simplifying architecture and UX.

---

#### ✅ **C. Precompile for ETH Transfers with Conditional Logic**

Create a **precompiled contract** (like the existing ones at `0x01–0x09`) for fast, conditional ETH transfers:

* Could validate conditions like slippage, address type, or timestamp
* Use cases: bridged ETH transfers with safeguards, conditional swaps, cross-domain transfers

> This would enable gas-efficient ETH logic *within smart contracts*, where today more general-purpose code is used at higher cost.

---

#### ✅ **D. EVM-Level "ETH-as-Gas-and-Value" Optimization**

Currently, ETH is used for *gas*, but not as a **payload** in function calls (unless wrapped).

To promote native ETH:

* Introduce an **EVM flag or ABI signature** that recognizes when ETH is being used *both* for gas and payload
* Give **execution priority** or **gas rebates** for such tx types

---

### 🔹 2. **L2 and Bridge-Specific Engineering Enhancements**

#### ✅ **E. Native ETH as Cross-Chain Value Primitive**

Most L2s use ETH for gas but **don’t support native ETH bridging** out of the box — you have to rely on WETH or custom bridge contracts.

Changes to consider:

* Let rollup bridges treat **ETH as a canonical L2 token**, and optimize withdrawal logic for:

  * No wrapping
  * Zero-copy bridge logic (no redundant encoding/decoding)

* Compress ETH-only tx calldata in rollup proofs (e.g., **zkEVMs** could optimize ETH-only circuits)

> This would make **native ETH bridging cheaper than ERC-20** bridging — structurally.

---

#### ✅ **F. Native ETH Multihop Bridge Pipelines**

Create a **standard protocol (EIP or rollup-native)** for:

* `swap on L2-A → bridge ETH → swap on L2-B`
* **All executed atomically** using native ETH, with no wrapping required

This would rely on:

* Rollup sequencer coordination
* Native ETH transfer proofs
* Interop standards like CCIP, IBC-like ETH envelopes, or zero-knowledge cross-chain proofs

---

## 🔐 Optional: Change Consensus Layer Incentives (very speculative)

* Make **validator rewards higher for ETH-native transactions** than ERC-20-based ones.
* For example: transactions using only ETH could pay **lower priority fees**.

This would tilt the **mempool fee market** in ETH’s favor over time.

## ✅ Final Thought

You're absolutely right: **we don’t need to wait for social engineering** if we want ETH to dominate as a routed or bridged asset. We can use **low-level EVM and L2 optimizations** to make **native ETH objectively cheaper and easier to use** than ERC-20s.
